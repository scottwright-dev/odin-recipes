      <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove</li>
      <li>1 yellow pepper</li>
      <li>10g parsley</li>
      <li>11g vegetable stock mix</li>
      <li>2 ciabattas</li>
      <li>30ml mayonnaise</li>
      <li>32g tomato paste</li>
      <li>15ml white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 carrot</li>
      <li>1 star anise</li>
      <li>2 x 150g fish fillets</li>
      <li>125g cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 brown onion</li>
      <li>You'll also need: butter, olive oil, pepper, sugar, salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4. Chop the cherry tomatoes
        in half. Peel and finely slice the brown onion[s]. Deseed the yellow
        pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into
        thin strips. Top, tail, peel and dice the carrot[s] and peel and finely
        chop the garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid)
        with a drizzle of olive oil and 10g [20g] butter over a medium heat.
        Once hot, add the sliced onion, diced carrot, chopped tomatoes, sliced
        pepper and half the garlic (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of
        salt and sugar. Add the star anise and cook for 8-10 min, or until the
        onion has started to soften and the tomatoes have broken down.
        Meanwhile, boil a kettle.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the vegetables are cooking, combine the vegetable stock mix and
        half of the ground turmeric (save the rest for later!) with 350ml
        [600ml] boiled water – this is your turmeric stock. Once the vegetables
        have softened, add the tomato paste and cook for 1 min, stirring
        continuously. Add the turmeric stock and bring to the boil over a high
        heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5-6 min or until
        reduced by half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine the remaining ground turmeric with 1 tsp [2 tsp]
        boiled water and stir until you have a smooth paste. Add the mayo,
        remaining chopped garlic and white wine vinegar. Whisk in a drizzle of
        olive oil with a pinch of black pepper – this is your sunny aioli.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ciabattas to a baking tray, drizzle them with a little olive oil
        and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min, or until they're hot and
        crusty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat the fish fillets dry with kitchen paper. Gently add the fish to the
        pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the fish is cooked through.
        Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the fish is cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the
        stalks. Stir most of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!)
        carefully through the cooked stew – this is your Mediterranean fish
        stew. Serve the stew with the hot ciabatta to the side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and drizzle over the sunny
        aioli. Tip: Don't forget to remove the star anise!
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
