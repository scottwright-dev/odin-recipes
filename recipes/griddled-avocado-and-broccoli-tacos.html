      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>3 ripe avocados</li>

      <li>16 tacos</li>
      <li>1 large bunch of fresh coriander (60g)</li>
      <li>250 g ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 splash of milk</li>
      <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a griddle pan over a high heat, scatter in 50g of pumpkin seeds
        and toast for 1 to 2 minutes, then remove to a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut 1 head of broccoli into 1cm slices, then toss in a little olive oil
        and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Lay them on the hot griddle
        and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until charred and just
        cooked through, you want them to retain a bit of bite.
      </li>
      <li>Peel, de-stone and slice 3 ripe avocados into wedges.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the broccoli from the griddle and add the avocado wedges,
        griddling until lightly charred on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the dressing, put 45g of fresh coriander (stalks and all) into a
        blender with 250g of ricotta and 1 splash of milk. Squeeze in the juice
        from 2 limes and peel and finely grate in 1 clove of garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt and pepper, blitz until combined, then spoon onto a
        platter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the dressing with the griddled veg and a drizzle of olive oil. Pick
        over the remaining 15g of coriander leaves and sprinkle with the toasted
        pumpkin seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish with a sprinkling of cayenne pepper. Serve with a pile of tacos
        and let everyone help themselves.
      </li>
    </ol>
