      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This Korean recipe is perfect for making with ingredients that are
        commonly found in a Korean pantry, such as day-old rice, kimchi,
        gochujang, and Korean toasted nori. These items are often found in
        Korean households, but they can also be useful to have in any pantry for
        making dishes like this one. Even if you are not of Korean heritage, it
        can be worth adding these items to your pantry staples to have on hand
        for easy meal prep.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For 2 people</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1½ cups kimchi</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tbsp gochujang (Korean chilli bean paste)</li>
      <li>4 cups cooked short grain rice (refrigerated)</li>
      <li>3 spring onions, finely sliced</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 egg (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
      <li>
        1 sheet Japanese nori, toasted and crumbled (or Korean nori sheets,
        crumbled)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Squeeze as much juice as you can from the kimchi and set it aside.
        Finely slice the kimchi.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a wok over high heat and add the vegetable oil and sesame oil. Add
        the kimchi to the wok and toss frequently until it is very fragrant. Add
        the gochujang and toss in the wok for about a minute until it is
        fragrant as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rice, pressing it onto the sides of the wok to separate the
        grains. Add the reserved kimchi juice, spring onions and salt, and mix
        everything very well, allowing the rice to very lightly toast against
        the sides of the wok.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate frying pan (or the same one after you’ve taken the rice
        out) fry the egg in a little oil until done to your liking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the egg on top of the rice, and scatter everything with sesame
        seeds and crumbled nori to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
