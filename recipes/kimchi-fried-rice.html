    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Korean recipe is perfect for making with ingredients that are
      commonly found in a Korean pantry, such as day-old rice, kimchi,
      gochujang, and Korean toasted nori. These items are often found in Korean
      households, but they can also be useful to have in any pantry for making
      dishes like this one. Even if you are not of Korean heritage, it can be
      worth adding these items to your pantry staples to have on hand for easy
      meal prep.
